virtual private network:(vpc)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
it is network layer, it is for security purpose and it has group of private ip adderess
by defualt the name itself suggest vpc is private and all ips adderess are private

key components of vpc:
----------------------
NAT-GW(will have elastic Ip)
IG-GW
VPC - endpoint

creating vpc:
------------------------------------------------------------------
we have to give ipv2_cidr range
10.0.0.0/25  ---- x.x.x.x/n --- 255.255.255.255/n
y = 32-n
2^n no.of ip adderess will be allocated to vpc
now we have divide them to the subnets

generally we will create these 3 subnets (private subnets, (private-data subnet, public subnet)
we will create subnets in all availability zones to make it HA(High availability)
we will create private subnet first and we will allocate more ip adderess to it( we are creating it first because 
since more traffic will be in the private subnet(app subnet) so will allocate more ips so that we can manage ips for other subnets if we create less usage ip adderess
first we end up with the shortage of ip's)


steps:
==========================
how to create vpc 
1) account---region---
ask: naming convention 
dev-vpc 
cidr range :10.0.0.0/16 
subnet decision 

1) create vpc --CIDR -10.0.0.0/16 
note: enable dns host name in vpc settings

Observation: VPC: routeTable, NACL , default sg 

2) create subnets 
dev-private-1a-subnet1 /18 - 10.0.0.0/18---check last ip 10.0.63.254
dev-private-1b-subnet2 /18 - 10.0.64.0/18---check last ip 10.0.127.254
dev-private-1c-subnet3 /18 - 10.0.128.0/18---check last ip address 10.0.191.254

dev-data-1a-subnet1 /21- 10.0.192.0/21--check last ip 10.0.199.254--- 	
dev-data-1b-subnet2 /21- 10.0.200.0/21--check last ip 10.0.207.254
dev-data-1c-subnet3 /21- 10.0.208.0/21--check last ip 10.0.215.254

dev-public-1a-subnet1 /21 - 10.0.216.0/21--check last ip 10.0.223.254
dev-public-1b-subnet2 /21 - 10.0.224.0/21---check last ip 10.0.231.254
dev-public-1c-subnet3 /21 - 10.0.232.0/21 --check last ip 10.0.239.254 
note: convert private to public by changing auto-assign public ip assignment

3) create igw and attach to vpc
4) create nat-gw in public subnet , observe allocate eip 
5) create route tables
associate public subnets into public-route
associate private subnets into private-route 
Edit routes: 
public route---0.0.0.0/0---igw
private route---0.0.0.0/0--nat-gw 

0.0.0.0/0----igw---publicRoute----publicSubnet---alb/bastion---

igw---vpc  publicRoute------publicSubnet  nat-gw  privateSubnets

lab: telnet/nc test from bastion to apache 
create timeout and solve it. 

why vpc endpoint:
----------------------
to access s3 from ec2 we have to go via nat-gw----internet---s3 which may lead 
hackers can hack and the cost is also more because bill will come for network out

in-order to overcome the issue we use vpc-endpoint this will communicate within
aws network, if you want to access any aws services, it wont take packets out to internet 
and to s3 

withoutvpc-endpoint:
-----------------------
ec2------nat-gw----internet-----s3

with vpc endpoint:
-----------------------
ec2-----nat-gw---vpc-endpoint---s3

vpc endpoint:
----------------
if you want to access aws service within vpc
---Don't go via nat-gw
---create vpc endpoint and map it to private route table
vpc endpoint types:
----------------------
1.Gateway endpoint
2.interface endpoint

i wanted to access s3 bucket from private subnet/private ec2
by default vpc/private subnet goes via nat-gw to s3 
if we wanted to avoud, create endpoints

we have to route vpc end point to  private route table since we are using
vpc endpoint to make connection secure and to make less cost since intially
we are going out with nat-gw to the any aws service and internet
now with vpc endpoint, it may leads to cost effective 
in aws the cost is for network out which is nat-gw in our case
so we are replacing the nat-gw with endpoint to communicate within aws 
network, which will reduces the cost


ec2----nat-gw---vpc endpoint -----aws services

-------------------------------
mistake i did and solved it
-------------------------------

i created nat-gw in private sub net and routeded in private route table
and i log in into the ec3 via bastion and tryied installing packages but 
getting time out, i was debugging using amazon reachability analyzer from apache 
to bastion and versa and i did not found any problem

lateri went and looked on in which subnet do i kept my nat-gw i kept it in private subnet
it is suppose to be in public subnet 
i created one more nat-gw in public subnet 
and routed into the private route table and it worked
"here is the mistake we should creat nat-ge i public subnet not in private subnet"

why we need to create nat-gw only in public subnet:.?
becuse:
your ec2 will be in private subnet,inorder to come from private to public we need a bridge
kind of thing to come,so natgw is the bridge btwn private and public

by the way to go inside the subnets i.e into the ec2's we use igw
from ec2 to outside we use nat-gw(allocated elastic ip)
*** max 5 elastic ips for region

---------------------------------------------------

if i wanted to track how many requests/how many ips are coming and how many
ips are rejecting/inbound/outbound flows we use "vpc flowlogs"
